After an initial deep dive presented to the ICMRA Policy group in October 2020 on initial experiences of the changes to regulatory oversight to remote ways of working driven by the pandemic, the group moved forward to start work on a reflection paper on GCP and GMP remote inspections during the pandemic. The paper is a collective reflection on the type of remote approaches taken by the different regulators across the globe, including:The paper also covers areas where we felt remote or distant assessment approaches were suitable versus those technical areas where on-site was required to ensure the appropriate safety and quality of products or trials, etc, being reviewed, and this is considered from both the GCP and GMP perspective. While this paper is a reflection paper, not a guidance document, the combined experience conveyed provides valuable insight into how regulators have managed regulatory oversight, inspections and assessments during the pandemic to support both the COVID-19 response, and also ‘business as usual’ GMP and GCP inspections.","After an initial deep dive presented to the ICMRA Policy group in October 2020 on initial experiences of the changes to regulatory oversight to remote ways of working driven by the pandemic, the group moved forward to start work on a reflection paper on GCP and GMP remote inspections during the pandemic.

The new OECD Data Integrity Advisory Document can be found here: https://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf/?cote=env/cbc/mono(2021)26&doclanguage=enThe OECD Advisory Document on Data Integrity takes precedence over the MHRA GXP Data Integrity Guidance, due to the UK’s membership of the OECD Mutual Acceptance of Data (MAD) System (further details on the international GLP framework can be found here (Being signed up to the OECD Mutual Acceptance of Data agreement is anything but MAD! - MHRA Inspectorate (blog.gov.uk)).The MHRA GXP Data Integrity Guidance was always intended to sit alongside additional regulatory guidance and should also continue to be used to supplement and support UK GLP facilities as it provides additional guidance primarily associated with the importance of a supportive organisational culture in order to embed and foster a strong data integrity culture within organisations. The differences can be summarised into the following groups of changes (this is not an exhaustive list, organisations should conduct their own review and assess the changes required and any impact on existing practices):Making the guidance specific for Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Definitions and guidance Additional contentMembers of the UK GLP Monitoring Programme should conduct a documented review of their existing data integrity processes against the OECD document to ensure that they fully comply and that any required changes or additions are implemented.","The MHRA published the GXP Data Integrity Guidance in March 2018 (see https://mhrainspectorate.blog.gov.uk/2018/03/09/mhras-gxp-data-integrity-guide-published/) and has subsequently led the development of an Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) advisory document on data integrity.

This followed the first joint event back in 2018, which resulted in the following paper: https://mhrainspectorate.blog.gov.uk/2020/06/30/mhra-and-fda-joint-paper-data-integrity-in-global-clinical-trials/We are pleased to say that, while the event seems like a world away from current times, our second joint paper resulting from this event has now been published and can be found here in Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics: Tackling Challenging Data Integrity. The paper discusses both agencies’ considerations on data integrity topics, from decentralised clinical trials, adaptive design trials and management of protocol deviations to real-world data. International collaboration has never been as important to the medicines lifecycle development as it has proved to be over the last 18 months, and it is great to see the published outcome of our collective thoughts on the challenges of data integrity in Good Clinical Practice.","The second Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) joint Good Clinical Practice (GCP) symposium was held in London in February 2020, covering international collaboration, sponsor oversight, electronic source documents, protocol deviations and data quality in novel clinical trial designs.
