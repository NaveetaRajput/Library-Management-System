Considering best practices, attendees will also learn how to plan for rapid development cycles by frontloading iterative prototype development and usability testing to validate design specifications and direction.”\\nRemedios will then moderate a panel discussion, Connected Device Design: Using Best Practices During the Product Development Process,\\xa0shortly after in 208AB on April 12 from 10:30 – 11:15 a.m. He will be joined by panelists Tom Ulrich, Ph.D. and Chief Scientist, Tandem Diabetes Care; Jeff Gross, Chief Technology Officer, Canary Medical; and Patrick Bangert, Vice President of AI, Samsung, SDSA.\\nThe group will discuss how to overcome the complexities of designing a connected medical device, including hardware and software design that incorporate robust cloud architecture, wireless protocols, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity.\\n“The safety and efficacy of a connected device is driven by the design integrity across a network of adjacent products and processes in a wider ecosystem,” Remedios explained. Attendees of the panel discussion “will learn development best practices that maximize the stability of interoperative technologies and the regulatory landscape, including privacy and use-safety challenges associated with widely varying environmental and operating conditions.” Examples will be presented across screening/diagnostics, disease management, and digital therapeutics, he added.\\n\u0027},\n  {\u0027keywords\u0027: \u0027device\u0027,\n   \u0027identifier\u0027: \u0027https://www.mddionline.com/regulatory-quality/regulations\u0027,\n   \u0027title\u0027: \u0027cloudcath wins fda nod for connected device that brings dialysis to the home\u0027,\n   \u0027url\u0027: \u0027https://www.mddionline.com/digital-health/cloudcath-wins-fda-nod-connected-device-brings-dialysis-home\u0027,\n   \u0027date\u0027: \u002730-03-2022\u0027,\n   \u0027content\u0027: \u0027Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are awaiting transplant are burdened with high-cost care and spending hours in a dialysis center to maintain some functionality in their kidneys. Approval for the CloudCath System may help some patients complete dialysis at home under the watchful eye of clinicians monitoring the device remotely, and at a significantly reduced cost. The company’s first-of-its-kind at-home peritoneal dialysis (PD) system won FDA 510(k) approval and is expected to have a limited launch in 2022, followed by full commercial launch in 2023.\\nDialysis care can be extremely expensive, averaging about $89,000 annually while at-home care can offer a significant cost savings at about $53,000 annually, according to the National Kidney Foundation’s American Journal of Kidney Diseases. At-home continuous monitoring may also help to avoid exacerbations, according to Aly Elbadry, chief executive officer of CloudCath.\\nDialysis Monitoring to Avoid Clinical Deterioration\\n“The CloudCath device is designed to support the clinician/patient partnership for at-home PD therapy,” said Elbadry, adding, “Actually, the entire dialysis ecosystem has a current and urgent goal to maximize use of home modalities.” Additional monitoring steps are expected to avert health decline. With a cloud-based digital connection, the PD monitoring system continuously provides data that can tip a physician off to a brewing health issue.\\n“Promising early data with the CloudCath System shows patients and clinicians may be alerted to the need for evaluation days before the onset of symptoms, enabling patients to seek early medical intervention, diagnosis, and treatment before escalation to hospitalization, catheter removal or death,” he said.\\nIntegrates with Current CCPD System\\nThe ongoing and nonobtrusive nature of the device allows it to be added to ESRD care with minimal effort on the part of the patient or his/her family. Patients can continue to use their current continuous cyclic PD (CCPD) device with CloudCath. The monitoring system is designed to integrate with a patient’s existing device, according to Elbadry. “Patients simply connect the CloudCath sensor and drain set, similar to their current drain set extensions, to their at-home CCPD cycler,” he said.\\n“As the dialysate fluid is drained, the CloudCath sensor uses advanced digital, optical sensors to assess the turbidity of fluid,” Elbadry said. “Changes in fluid turbidity are detected by CloudCath’s proprietary cloud-based algorithm and notifications are sent to clinicians and patients to alert them to seek additional medical evaluation.”\\nCloudCath’s system has the potential to shift the PD monitoring landscape which in its current state is fragmented, with options ranging from paper-based tests, evaluating drainage lines, or waiting for symptoms. Instead, CloudCath’s device system looks for signs of infection or complication indicated by clouded dialysate fluid. When cloudy fluid is detected by the PD monitoring system, it is a trigger for the patient and physician to coordinate additional care.\\nNew Standard of Dialysis Care with Monitoring\\nCloudCath envisions the monitoring system could be part of future standard of care in PD for ESRD patients. That could also extend to other settings. “Although focused on home PD, of\\xa0course, the CloudCath System can also be used in healthcare settings like longterm care facilities and, in the rare case that a patient moves to a hospital and continues PD treatment, the CloudCath System could be used in a hospital setting,” said Elbadry.\\n\u0027}],\n [{\u0027identifier\u0027:

The 45,500 affected products with the product code 83QKP were distributed from June 2 to Dec. 21, 2021.The FDA says that although it has not received any reports of injuries, adverse health consequences or death due to use of the affected test kits, “false-positive or false-negative results from improper use of these tests could lead to further exposure of uninfected individuals to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.The agency also noted “serious injury risks if someone who is not trained to collect a nasopharyngeal swab sample attempts to do so.”    \u0027}],\n [{\u0027identifier\u0027: \u0027https://www.medtechdive.com/topic/medical-devices/\u0027,\n   \u0027title\u0027: \u0027Notified body update dampens hopes of near-term surge in IVDR capacity\u0027,\n   \u0027url\u0027: \u0027https://www.medtechdive.com/news/notified-body-update-ivdr-mdr/621238/\u0027,\n   \u0027date\u0027: \u002730-03-2022\u0027,\n   \u0027keywords\u0027: \u0027notified body\u0027,\n   \u0027content\u0027: \u0027The European Commission provided an update on the progress of notified body applications under the new regulations, revealing a growing pipeline of submissions that are approaching medical device designation but little hope of a near-term surge in in vitro diagnostic capacity.\\xa0The Commission\\\u0027s March 21 update of the notified body pipeline reveals limited progress of the push to add more organizations capable of certifying products under the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation.At the time of the December update, there were six notified bodies designated under IVDR.\\xa0Another was in the final stages of the process, with\\xa0designation and its addition to the EU\\\u0027s New Approach Notified and Designated Organizations (NANDO)\\xa0database as the only two remaining steps.\\xa0While that suggests the addition of a seventh IVDR notified body is on the horizon, there is then a gap back to the next organizations coming down the pipeline. Two other notified bodies have progressed to the joint assessment team corrective action and preventive action (JAT CAPA)\\xa0review stage since December, but none have made it past.\\xa0\\xa0The early-stage pipeline has made little progress since December. One more notified body has applied, bringing the total up to 18, but the numbers for the first few steps in the process are the same as they were in December.\\xa0As was the case in December, 12 notified bodies, including all those that have progressed further down the pipeline, have completed an onsite review by a joint assessment team (JAT). Ten notified bodies have received the final corrective action and preventive action (CAPA)\\xa0review, up two from December.The upshot is the problems that led the EU to switch to a staggered rollout of IVDR are unlikely to change this year, unless there is a sharp acceleration of the designation process.The Commission proposed longer IVDR transition periods because of the \"grave shortage of notified body capacity\" that was made worse by the fact all the designated notified bodies were concentrated in three countries. The lack of progress means those issues may remain in place as the waves of IVDR deadlines approach.\\xa0When the Commission shared an update late last year, it revealed that seven notified bodies were at the JAT CAPA\\xa0plan review stage for designation under the Medical Device Regulation. Overall, 36 notified bodies had reached that stage, 27 of which had progressed to the next step and 25 of which had completed the process and had their information uploaded to the NANDO database.The latest update, which covers the situation as of March 21, reveals a clutch of notified bodies has now cleared the JAT CAPA review stage, putting them a handful of steps from the end of the MDR designation process. The current count shows another three notified bodies have advanced to the final report stage over the past few months.\\xa0One of those notified bodies is still at the final report stage but the other two have made more progress, with one at the JAT final opinion step and the other designated and awaiting entry to NANDO. The recent progress suggests the pool of medical device designated notified bodies in NANDO, which has increased by two to 27 since December, will swell further over the coming months.\\xa0The two recent additions to NANDO include a Polish notified body, meaning MDR organizations from 18 countries are now in the database. The geographic concentration of notified bodies in parts of Europe has been a concern because small and medium-sized companies are perceived to prefer to work locally.\\xa0Progression of the MDR pipeline comes amid continued concern about whether the European Union has enough notified body capacity to ensure the smooth implementation of the regulation. Last month, France\\\u0027s Snitem and Germany\\\u0027s BVMed, leading medtech trade associations that cover more than half of the EU medical device market, called for the extension of the MDR transition period to avoid a \"collapse in patient care.\"According to the trade groups, fewer than 1,000 of the 25,000 required certificates have been issued. The trade groups argue that, with more products to be certified and more extensive document checks needed, the pool of 27 notified bodies falls well short of the capacity needed to avoid disruption.\\xa0The concerns echo those raised since the EU delayed the MDR start date by one year in response to the pandemic but left the end of the transition period unchanged, thereby averting a near-term threat but potentially storing up trouble for later.Notified body trade association Team-NB has repeatedly raised concerns about the transition period, most recently in December, when it warned the industry will face an \"extreme bottleneck\" when a large number of Medical Device Directive certificates expire in 2024.\u0027},\n  {\u0027identifier\u0027: \u0027https://www.medtechdive.com/topic/medical-devices/\u0027,\n   \u0027title\u0027: \u0027FDA asks Congress for 14% bump in device budget for supply chain, cybersecurity programs\u0027,\n   \u0027url\u0027: \u0027https://www.medtechdive.com/news/fda-congress-device-budget-supply-chain-cyber/621156/\u0027,\n   \u0027date\u0027: \u002729-03-2022\u0027,\n   \u0027keywords\u0027: \u0027device\u0027,\n   \u0027content\u0027: \u0027The FDA is requesting an overall budget of $8.4 billion in fiscal year 2023, a nearly 34% increase over the FY 2022 appropriated funding level. For the devices program, the FDA is asking for roughly $698 million, with approximately $466 million from the budget authority and $232 million in user fees.The agency\\\u0027s request for more budget authority from Congress is split fairly evenly between money for medical product safety and crosscutting, a term that captures work such as capacity building and inspection activities that span multiple departments. FDA Commissioner Robert Califf in a statement said the budget request is critical as the agency continues to work on a wide range of COVID-19 and non-coronavirus priorities, with a focus on some of the most urgent needs including medical device safety and security.At $31.4 million, the safety program is in line to receive slightly more money, reflecting the fact that it covers the single biggest change in FDA\\\u0027s medical device spending plans for fiscal 2023, namely RSCSP. The budget proposes investing $21.6 million in the program.\"This funding will provide resources that will enable establishment of a permanent program for U.S. supply chain resilience for medical devices for the first time. The establishment of a permanent device shortages program will help ensure U.S. patients and health care providers have access to the critical devices they need and help reduce U.S. dependence on devices from other nations by enhancing CDRH\\\u0027s capacity to enable rapid intervention to prevent and mitigate supply chain interruptions,\" the FDA wrote in its budget justification.The agency envisages RSCSP using \"state of the art supply chain intelligence for predictive modeling, early signal detection and continuous surveillance\"\\xa0as part of a push to establish preventative measures that make the supply chain more resilient by enabling the agency to avert shortages before they occur.The FDA said the funding is critical to reducing or eliminating the risk of medical device shortages experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to ensure the U.S.\\xa0is better prepared for future public health emergencies.\\xa0The RSCSP funding covers 18 full-time equivalents (FTEs), representing more than one-third of the 48 staff FDA plans to add in fiscal 2023. FDA plans to add six FTEs if it secures its requested $5 million funding boost for its cybersecurity program. The funding boost will bring FDA\\\u0027s total medical device cybersecurity budget up to $5.5 million.\\xa0FDA wants to take on the six FTEs to \"increase its internal capabilities through the recruitment and development of cyber experts to support the review of medical devices and assure that they are highly resistant to security breaches before being marketed.\"\\xa0The funding will also enable the agency to administer grants and contracts \"to develop infrastructure geared towards addressing emerging challenges in order to strengthen cybersecurity resilience in the medical device ecosystem, such as tools to track vulnerabilities associated with devices.\"The FDA wants to establish \"tangible measures\"\\xa0of cybersecurity such as time from vulnerability identification to remediation.In addition, the FDA is asking Congress for the \"express authority\"\\xa0to require premarket submissions to include evidence of \"reasonable assurance of the device\\\u0027s safety and effectiveness for purposes of cybersecurity\"\\xa0and for devices to \"have the capability to be updated and patched in a timely manner.\"Currently, there is no statutory pre- or post-market requirement that expressly requires medical device manufacturers to address cybersecurity, according to the agency. The FDA\\\u0027s FY 2023 budget includes a legislative proposal that \"seeks additional authorities across the lifecycle of the device and includes elements such as a software bill of materials.\"The FDA is also seeking a further $26.4 million and 24 FTEs in relation to crosscutting work such as capacity building and inspection activities that span multiple departments.Pay costs are the biggest crosscutting budgetary line item, with the agency calculating that the 4.6% cost of living adjustment and 1.1% increase in retirement contributions will require an additional $8.1 million for the devices program.\\xa0Most of the crosscutting FTEs are earmarked for inspection activities. The FDA plans to take on 14 FTEs to \"support capacity building towards an advanced, highly trained investigators capable of analyzing available data to increase the efficiency and productivity of our inspection operations.\"\u0027},\n  {\u0027identifier\u0027: \u0027https://www.medtechdive.com/topic/medical-devices/\u0027,\n   \u0027title\u0027: \u0027MDR updates safety, clinical performance requirement for high-risk devices\u0027,\n   \u0027url\u0027: \u0027https://www.medtechdive.com/news/mdr-safety-performance-requirement-high-risk-devices/621089/\u0027,\n   \u0027date\u0027: \u002728-03-2022\u0027,\n   \u0027keywords\u0027: \u0027device\u0027,\n   \u0027content\u0027: \u0027MDCG, which advises the European Commission on medical device matters, created the 2019 guidance to help manufacturers and notified bodies comply with a transparency provision of MDR.

The new agreement includes accountability measures that might have helped win over industry. For instance, the FDA must meet certain hiring targets, and is also limited to 13 weeks of operating reserves in its carryover balance.\\xa0Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA\\\u0027s Center for Devices and Radiological Health,\\xa0said in a news release\\xa0that the new agreement \"represents a substantial investment in the future of the agency\\\u0027s medical device program and would provide for important improvements, including new hiring targets, greater engagement with developers of innovative technologies based on lessons learned from the pandemic, broadened international harmonization efforts and expanded opportunities to ensure patient perspectives are an integral part of medical device development.\"This comes as the FDA has struggled to meet its performance targets in recent months, as a significant portion of the agency\\\u0027s resources has been dedicated to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The problem caused 25 injuries at the time of the recall.Philips began the latest recall of V60 ventilators in January. The recall, which is distinct from the flow rate problem, covers 1,511 devices distributed over a two-week period last summer. Philips put the devices together using an expired adhesive. FDA set out the potential implications of that quality failure in its notice to communicate the Class I recall.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\"If the adhesive fails, it could cause a capacitor support bracket to become loose and potentially damage the capacitors, which could cause the ventilator to stop providing ventilation to the patient. This failure may cause an alarm to notify the health care provider, or it may not sound any alarm at all,\"\\xa0the agency wrote.The effect of the cessation of ventilation on the patient will depend on whether an alarm sounds. In the worst-case scenario, the lack of an alarm could leave the patient deprived of oxygen for \"an extended time,\"\\xa0FDA said, potentially leading to serious adverse health consequences and death.Philips asked users of affected devices to connect their ventilators to remote alarm systems, if available, when it first communicated the problem to customers in January. The remote alarm provides a backup that should sound even if the ventilator\\\u0027s primary alarm system fails to go off.Other recommended precautions include the provision of external oxygen monitoring to minimize patient risk if the device fails.\\xa0News of the recall comes months after Philips expanded its program to repair and replace devices that use the potentially harmful sound abatement foam. \u0027},\n  {\u0027identifier\u0027: \u0027https://www.medtechdive.com/topic/medical-devices/\u0027,\n   \u0027title\u0027: \u0027FDA labels Philips 2018 field correction for ventilators a Class I recall\u0027,\n   \u0027url\u0027: \u0027https://www.medtechdive.com/news/fda-labels-philips-correction-class-i-recall/620804/\u0027,\n   \u0027date\u0027: \u002722-03-2022\u0027,\n   \u0027keywords\u0027: \u0027recall\u0027,\n   \u0027content\u0027: \u0027In June, Philips initiated a recall of sleep apnea and ventilator machines due to safety risks associated with polyester-based polyurethane (PE-PUR) foam used to dampen the sound of the devices.

Philips found that that foam used to dampen the noise of machines could break down and the particles can be inhaled or ingested by users, possibly exposing them to toxic chemicals.The company has come under fire for how it has handled the recall, and now the FDA\\\u0027s order adds to the hundreds of consumer and commercial lawsuits Philips is facing.The agency listed out several directives and recommendations for how the company can improve its recall communication process and how it should improve its repair and replacement program for impacted devices.Now that the FDA has issued an order, Philips will \"need to implement action in response to the order within the timelines prescribed,\" Heyl said. However, Heyl added that any enhancements to Philips\\\u0027 recall process overall will be up to the company to change.The recall adds to several other product safety events in the medical device industry, which led to the FDA holding two public meetings reviewing the device recall process, and it is emblematic of concerns with the recall process in general.In an October meeting, the lack of effective communication to patients was a topic that came up multiple times, and it is a key critique of product safety and supply chain experts.The lack of a clear requirement or accountability for patient communication, experts argue, can lead to patients never learning that a device they use or have had implanted is part of a recall, an issue that has come up with Philips.Along with patients and customers not being aware of the recall, the FDA wrote in its letter to the company that \"it is likely that a significant portion of patients and consumers using the Recalled Products are unaware of the health risks presented by those products.\"To determine how the recall process was going, the FDA conducted its own test and found that consignees,\\xa0or suppliers of devices, were not aware of the recall after it began.The agency reached out to 182 suppliers and found that 28 were not aware of the recall, according to the FDA\\\u0027s letter. Suppliers were selected because \"if consignees are unaware of the recall and the health risks posed by the Recalled Products, it is likely that their customers are also unaware.\"The FDA emailed Philips about the results of their assessment on Sept. 8 and Oct. 29. However, Philips did not respond to either email, according to the agency.The company said during a Nov. 22 call with the FDA that there was \"delivery confirmation\" for 23 of the 28 consignees and provided a spreadsheet identifying this information, according to the FDA.\"However, that spreadsheet did not include the date that each confirmation was received, nor did Philips indicate whether the consignees identified by FDA had been sent notification before, or only after, they had been identified by FDA as being unaware of the recall,\" the letter stated.The FDA added that delivery confirmation does not mean that someone or some entity has actually received the notice and information in the notice, adding that firms \"demonstrate the effectiveness of its recall communications through evidence more meaningful than a delivery confirmation receipt, such as a returned response form or a documented telephone conversation.\"Philips said in a press release that it has reached the \"vast majority\" of users in the U.S. and 2.6 million devices have been registered. In an emailed statement, however, the company would not comment on how many remaining users there were to reach in the U.S. or how many total affected devices there are in the U.S.A company spokesperson said in a statement emailed Monday to MedTech Dive that the company is also working with international regulators about the recall.Philips estimates that the repair and replacement program will be completed in the fourth quarter. As of January, the company has set aside 725 million euros to address the recall, which was equal to about $825 million at the time of the announcement.The FDA\\\u0027s main directive is for Philips to reach out to all of its customers regarding the recall and the health risks of using the affected devices.The agency said that Philips can get the contact information for patients, consumers or providers that received a product from a particular consignee, and then Philips can contact each customer within 30 days of receiving the information.The second option laid out by the FDA was that Philips receive confirmation from consignees that they have contacted every customer within 30 days of receiving Philips\\\u0027 notification.The FDA also outlined several recommendations for Philips, such as developing a strategy to improve patient and customer registration of devices online and regularly update the agency with new registration figures, improving the sharing of information about the recall and repair and replacement program, as well as providing \"detailed information\" regarding the replacement process such as any costs that may come with replacing a device.The agency also recommended that the company responds within 24 hours to customers who reach out to a recall-assistance phone number.Hogan Lovell\\\u0027s Heyl said that companies generally work with the FDA to address recommendations.\"If there is disagreement with an FDA recommendation, a company should promptly indicate this to the agency with its rationales or arguments supporting its position or strategy,\" Heyl said. \"The more fact or evidence-based the position, or the more data that there are to support the company\\\u0027s position, the better the likelihood that FDA will agree and either support modified language or drop the recommendation altogether.\"Philips has within 45 days of the order to comply.\\xa0If companies do not comply with FDA orders in general, Heyl said, there are multiple \"enforcement options available,\" ranging from further talks with the company to a warning letter, or even criminal fines and penalties depending on the circumstances.A Philips spokesperson reiterated Monday that the company is complying with the FDA\\\u0027s requests.\"There isn\\\u0027t anything in the Order that we have already been doing or are about to do,\" the spokesperson wrote in the emailed statement. \"We therefore expect to fully comply with the Order.\"\u0027},\n  {\u0027identifier\u0027: \u0027https://www.medtechdive.com/topic/medical-devices/\u0027,\n   \u0027title\u0027: \u0027US replaces EU as priority market for medtech industry: survey\u0027,\n   \u0027url\u0027: \u0027https://www.medtechdive.com/news/us-replaces-eu-priority-market-medtechs/620450/\u0027,\n   \u0027date\u0027: \u002716-03-2022\u0027,\n   \u0027keywords\u0027: \u0027medtech\u0027,\n   \u0027content\u0027: \u0027The past few years have seen regulators on both sides of the Atlantic change their approach to medtech.

The BCG report adds to evidence that FDA is on course to achieve its objective.\\xa0\\xa0The shift in focus from the EU to the U.S. appears to have at least as much to do with what Europe has done to alienate the industry as what FDA has done to woo it. For 23% of companies with CE marks, the EU has now fallen behind Japan and China on the list of priority markets, reflecting concerns about the impact of MDR and other factors.\"Respondents overwhelmingly view new MDR rules as complex and unpredictable, making it less appealing to develop and launch novel products in Europe. Other factors, including Brexit and intense reimbursement pricing pressure, may also reduce the attractiveness of pursuing the CE mark,\"\\xa0the BCG report states.Only 22% of respondents said the EU pathway for regulatory approval of standard medical technology is predictable. The figure for the U.S. was 62%. There is still room to improve for FDA, particularly with 33% of respondents viewing its digital product pathway as predictable, but there was broad support for some of its key initiatives and a perception that it now offers a clearer path to market than the EU.In the survey, 79% of respondents strongly agreed or somewhat agreed that the FDA is responding effectively to advancements in medical technology. When its comes to artificial intelligence and machine learning, surveyed executives contend U.S. regulators also have the advantage.The BCG report notes that medtech companies are developing AI/ML products at an accelerating rate.\"Of the 343 approvals of such products by the FDA since 1997, more than half occurred in 2019 and 2020.

The FDA and the medical device industry often were at loggerheads\\xa0over \"fundamentally different\"\\xa0views during the months-long negotiations that got off to a late start in early 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The FDA, perhaps in an indication of that agency-industry divide,\\xa0failed to send the final MDUFA V agreement to Congress by the Jan. 15 deadline. By comparison, the FDA\\\u0027s commitment letter\\xa0to the pharmaceutical sector was published in August. However, both the agency and AdvaMed now can see the light at the end of the tunnel.The MDUFA V deal, which determines how much industry pays for FDA product reviews from 2023 to 2027 and what performance goals the agency will be measured against, in the end was about compromise, according to the industry source familiar with the negotiations.\"The sticking points weren\\\u0027t necessarily complicated so much as FDA being dug in on what they wanted and we were dug in on what we wanted. It took a while for some common ground to be found,\" the industry source said. \"The final agreement is pretty consensus-focused and not one side dominating the other.\"One of the FDA\\\u0027s priorities that was ultimately included in the MDUFA V agreement was funding for the agency’s proposed total product lifecycle advisory program (TAP), which industry initially opposed.The agency pitched TAP as a way \"to enable earlier, more frequent, and more strategic communication between FDA and sponsors, as well as to facilitate sponsors\\\u0027 early engagement and coordination with external stakeholders that impact patient access to medical technologies, such as payors and physician professional societies.\"However, industry representatives in talks with the FDA questioned the need for the program and voiced their doubts about whether private payors would participate. In the end, the agency prevailed with some caveats.In the MDUFA V agreement, TAP will be funded as a pilot with a MDUFA IV carryover balance of $110 million and an additional $45 million from base funding,\\xa0according to the industry source, who noted that there will be a pilot mid-point assessment and evaluation during MDUFA VI negotiations.The agreement also caps the FDA\\\u0027s MDUFA V carryover balances to three months reserve, similar to the way it is set up for the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments (PDUFA), the source added. The use of funds would require \"an alignment\" and input from industry.Under the MDUFA V agreement, there are hiring targets established for the FDA, which was one of the requirements advocated for by industry. The agency must meet an 85% hiring target in fiscal year 2023 and a 90% hiring target in FY 2024.Last month, the FDA\\\u0027s Center for Devices and Radiological Health said its goal\\xa0is to achieve at least 90% of its annual center-wide hiring targets in its 2023 to 2025 fiscal years. The commitment, which CDRH made in a report on its 2022-2025 strategic priorities, comes as the center\\\u0027s resources continue to be strained by a COVID-19 workload and follows MDUFA V talks that exposed industry concerns\\xa0about the number of vacancies at the agency.AdvaMed\\\u0027s Whitaker in a statement on Wednesday thanked the FDA \"for their commitment and hard work\" throughout the MDUFA V negotiations process, adding that the medtech lobby is looking forward to \"input and guidance from Congress on the agreement going forward.\"\\xa0\u0027},\n  {\u0027identifier\u0027: \u0027https://www.medtechdive.com/topic/medical-devices/\u0027,\n   \u0027title\u0027: \u0027FDA warns of cyber vulnerabilities in medical device software components\u0027,\n   \u0027url\u0027: \u0027https://www.medtechdive.com/news/fda-cyber-vulnerabilities-PTC-Axeda-medical-device-software-/620075/\u0027,\n   \u0027date\u0027: \u002709-03-2022\u0027,\n   \u0027keywords\u0027: \u0027device | software\u0027,\n   \u0027content\u0027: \u0027All versions of PTC\\\u0027s Axeda agent and desktop server are affected by the Access:7 cyber vulnerabilities, according to FDA\\\u0027s alert to device users and manufacturers.

This isn\\\u0027t just a case of a missed vulnerability. The presence of hard-coded credentials shows a distinct disregard for creating a secure product. And, this is a remote desktop, one of the most targeted classes of products,\" Gates said.In response to a query from MedTech Dive, PTC declined to comment on the vulnerabilities of its Axeda agent and desktop server and instead pointed to its advisory.Mike Rushanan, director of medical security at consultancy Harbor Labs, contends that hard-coded credentials in particular – the software development practice of embedding authentication data such as passwords directly into the source code – are a significant cybersecurity risk.\"Manufacturers, especially medical device manufacturers, must not hard-code any credentials – passwords and cryptographic keys. And, they must force users to update default credentials immediately on first use,\" Rushanan said.Axel Wirth, chief security strategist of medical device cyber firm MedCrypt, called it \"astounding\" that nine years after CISA issued one of its early cybersecurity alerts calling out the risk of hard-coded passwords, the medtech industry is still seeing advisories that are related to hard-coded credentials.Becton Dickinson on Tuesday in a statement said it is \"aware of and actively monitoring\" vulnerabilities associated with PTC\\\u0027s Axeda\\xa0agent and desktop server, which are no longer used in BD\\\u0027s products.\"Prior to August 2019, select BD diagnostic and biosciences products, including older versions of BD Assurity Linc, were offered with Axeda Agent and/or Axeda Desktop Server.\\xa0BD is proactively reaching out to customers who may still have Axeda Agent or Axeda Desktop Server in limited instances to assist in removing the application,\" the medtech said, noting that it has not received any reports of the vulnerabilities being exploited on its products.However, BD last month disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities in its Viper and Pyxis\\xa0products that allow for the use of hard-coded credentials. BD voluntarily reported the vulnerabilities to CISA and the FDA.CISA last week issued two separate advisories warning that successful exploitation of BD\\\u0027s Viper hard-coded credential vulnerability \"could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete sensitive information,\" while the company\\\u0027s Pyxis hard-coded credential vulnerability \"could allow an attacker to gain access to electronic protected health information (ePHI) or other sensitive information.\"\u0027},\n  {\u0027identifier\u0027: \u0027https://www.medtechdive.com/topic/medical-devices/\u0027,\n   \u0027title\u0027: \u0027Medtronic, Nevro boosted by expansion of Medicare coverage for diabetic pain devices\u0027,\n   \u0027url\u0027: \u0027https://www.medtechdive.com/news/medtronic-nevro-boosted-by-expansion-of-medicare-coverage-for-diabetic-pai/620076/\u0027,\n   \u0027date\u0027: \u002709-03-2022\u0027,\n   \u0027keywords\u0027: \u0027device\u0027,\n   \u0027content\u0027: \u0027Noridian\\\u0027s update adds two new ICD-10 codes for PDN to a pair of documents, A57791 and A57792, that address the use of SCS in chronic pain. The Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) covers Medicare patients in Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Nevro said the Noridian update covers around 8% of PDN patients in the U.S.Working to capture what management sees as an \"important driver\"\\xa0of long-term growth, Nevro needs to grow coverage of SCS in PDN to kickstart its business. The addition of Noridian coverage, which applies retroactively to procedures performed since the start of the year, keeps Nevro on track to meet analyst expectations.\\xa0“The announcement is consistent with our expectation that PDN coverage expansion would be forthcoming in 2022 and beyond. For reference, we model FY22 and FY23 PDN revenue of $28.5M \u0026 $53M, respectively, and view these as achievable estimates,\"\\xa0analysts at Truist Securities wrote in a note to investors.Truist modeled $23 million and $38 million in PDN sales for 2022 and 2023, respectively, at the time of the UnitedHealthcare coverage decision. Since then, Medtronic has won approval ahead of schedule. The Truist analysts said the presence of Medtronic \"will help develop the referral channel\"\\xa0but could also \"strip away near-term ... upside optionality\"\\xa0for Nevro.The arrival of Medtronic in the market means expanding coverage benefits both Nevro and its rival. At the time of the Medtronic approval, analysts said Nevro management \"wants to rectify\"\\xa0the fact that the UnitedHealthcare coverage is not specific to their device. Yet, as it stands, neither UnitedHealthcare nor Noridian has differentiated between the Nevro and Medtronic devices in their coverage.\"Noridian\\\u0027s update is not exclusive to any one waveform or frequency but rather based on the overall body of evidence which supports SCS as a treatment option for these patients,\"\\xa0a Medtronic spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \"We will continue to engage with outstanding Medicare contractors and private payers to share existing clinical evidence to encourage the addition of diabetic peripheral neuropathy to their coverage policies where needed,\"\\xa0Nevro put a positive spin on Medtronic\\\u0027s FDA approval, with CEO Keith Grossman using a conference call to discuss fourth quarter results to argue\\xa0\"having a second market participant raising awareness about this indication with referring doctors and patients can only be helpful in developing the referral channel and in accelerating market expansion.\"\\xa0Grossman made the case that Nevro has the stronger data.The challenge for Nevro now is to translate its claimed advantages into sales growth. Work to grow sales in PDN from the $4 million generated in the fourth quarter should benefit from further SCS coverage decisions.\\xa0\"We expect to have announcements like this throughout the year as we continue our activities to expand payer outreach to include spinal cord stimulation coverage for peripheral diabetic neuropathy,\"\\xa0a spokesperson for Nevro said. \"We will provide updates on those payer decisions as they arise and expect our payer coverage to increase gradually over time with a steady increase in positive coverage decisions occurring throughout the year.\"\\xa0\u0027}],\n [{\u0027identifier\u0027: \u0027https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles\u0027,\n   \u0027title\u0027: \u0027shuren apologizes for mdufa delay, says fda will start closing the spigot on new euas\u0027,\n   \u0027url\u0027: \u0027https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2022/3/shuren-apologizes-for-mdufa-delay-says-fda-will-st\u0027,\n   \u0027date\u0027: \u002730-03-2022\u0027,\n   \u0027keywords\u0027: \u0027mdufa\u0027,\n   \u0027content\u0027: \u0027\\n      The head of the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) device center was criticized by top House lawmakers for not getting a Medical Device User Fee Amendments (MDUFA V) deal to them for review on time. He apologized for missing the statutory deadline and noted his staff have been slammed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nOn 30 March, the House Energy and Commerce (E\u0026C) subcommittee on health met to discuss renewing FDA’s MDUFA program. At the start of the meeting committee Chair Frank Pallone (D-NJ) and Ranking Member Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-OR), scolded Jeff Shuren, director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), for missing the 15 January deadline to submit a MDUFA V commitment letter. (RELATED: MDUFA V: Commitment letter includes TPLC pilot, claw back provisions and more, Regulatory Focus 23 March 2022)\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nThe letter is a tentative deal between FDA and the medtech industry on how much revenue the agency will bring in over the next five years to help pay for reviewing premarket applications while also setting performance goals for reviewers to meet.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n“This deadline is not a mere suggestion it\\\u0027s actually the law and the process is important because it allows for the FDA, industry and members of the public to examine what has worked well, and where review programs can be improved through the reauthorization process,” said Pallone. “It also provides Congress with time to thoroughly review these recommendations and reauthorize the program ahead of the funding deadline.”\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nPallone noted that FDA and industry were not only delayed two months but since they only got the letter a week ago there hasn’t been enough time for the agency to collect public comments on the deal which he argued has serious unanswered questions on a number of issues. Despite the delay, he said Congress will get the program reauthorized before it expires on 30 September, so that FDA isn’t forced to lay off staff paid through the device user fee program.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n“I\\\u0027m not trying to beat you up Dr. Shuren but the bottom line is we get this two months later, we\\\u0027re going to meet our deadline because we don\\\u0027t want to have the pink slips but I remember a few years ago when the pink slips went out and everybody was saying, \\\u0027Well Congress why didn\\\u0027t you do this quicker?\\\u0027” Pallone said. “Well in this case it\\\u0027s your fault. I don\\\u0027t know how else to put it.”\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nMcMorris Rodgers, also piled on and expressed her disappointment with FDA and industry for missing the deadline and only giving lawmakers a week to review the deal. She also noted that she’s concerned about “the lack of transparency” throughout the MDUFA negotiation process and wrote to then acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock about the agency’s delay in posting meeting minutes.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n\"To ensure transparency and progress, documentation of meeting outcomes and action items are supposed to be made part of the official record and made publicly available,” she said. “While posting minutes publicly takes no more than two to three weeks, during MDUFA V negotiations we saw delays of 6 months. Even today there are no meeting minutes posted for any meetings that took place after June 30, 2021.\"\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nIn response to the criticism, Shuren apologized to lawmakers for the delay and noted that his staff have had to put a lot of things on the backburner to prioritize their work on developing guidances and reviewing emergency use authorization (EUA) applications related to the pandemic.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n\"I want you to know I personally regret that we missed the statutory deadline to deliver our recommendations to congress. I and the entire agency take this obligation very seriously,” he said. “I am pleased to report however that the long deliberations have ultimately produced a strong thoughtful agreement on recommendations to congress that if enacted will continue to advance medical device innovation while maintaining the FDA’s standards to protect patients.\"\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nShuren noted that while the agency met or exceeded its MDUFA obligations at the start of the pandemic, it eventually was overwhelmed and ended up falling short on a number of metrics due to increase in workload for which the agency wasn’t well-funded. He also added that its reviewers received 15 times the number of EUAs that they typically see during a public health emergency (PHE) and overall received 8,000 EUAs of which they’ve authorized 2,200. They are reportedly still receiving about 130 EUA applications a month.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n\"This has been a perfect storm my center has been battling for two years… with many of my staff burning the midnight oil and burning out in the process,\" said Shuren.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nIf Congress fails to reauthorize the MDUFA deal by September, Shuren warned that FDA will have to start laying off staff which could lead to delays in product reviews and the US risks losing its edge in getting medical technologies to market first.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nPallone asked Shuren, what could be done to make the MDUFA negotiation deal better so that the same kind of delay is avoided in another five years when MDUFA VI is being negotiated.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nShuren again noted that this was an unusual situation because FDA was delayed due to the pandemic but suggested adding an additional deadline.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n“This was us and industry saying we\\\u0027re getting hammered with COVID, we need more time,” he said. “One thing maybe congress can do is rather than just have the date when you have to come to congress, have the date when we have to sit down and get this started so we have enough lead time to get it done.\"\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nMcMorris Rodgers pushed on the fact FDA hasn’t provided meeting minutes on negotiations between itself and industry since 30 June and asked Shuren how many meetings have been held since. She noted that the lack of minutes means lawmakers and the public has been left without much context on how the MDUFA deal was developed.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nPast reporting has indicated that FDA and industry also suddenly halted public negotiations in late November and then went into overdrive after the 15 January deadline to finally come to an agreement. McMorris Rodgers pressed Shuren on how many meetings were held between FDA and industry in that timeframe.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nShuren noted that while the meeting minutes have not been posted, he estimates FDA and industry met over a dozen times since 30 June to hash out a deal. He explained that MDUFA negotiations are very sensitive like international treaties with a lot of parties involved and all sides were more focused on reaching a deal.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n\"We put the priority on getting the deal done than the meeting minutes,\" he said.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nShuren also noted that while there weren’t a lot of in-person meetings between December and January, there were a lot of offline discussions with industry to get to a deal.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nRep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), chair of the health subcommittee, asked Shuren what FDA’s plan is over the long term to help alleviate the extra burdens caused by the agency’s response to EUAs.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nShuren said the agency is taking steps to narrow their focus to EUA devices that are especially important in the pandemic fight.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n\"Over the coming months the goal really is to start turning off the spigot on EUAs [because] there\\\u0027s enough product out there,\" he said.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nDuring the hearing McMorris Rodgers noted that FDA published two draft guidances in December on transitioning EUA products to regular marketing authorization. In response, industry groups have raised concerns that the agency’s proposed guidances don’t give companies enough time to submit a premarket application and make labeling changes. https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2022/3/stakeholders-ask-for-more-time-to-transition-eua-d\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nShe asked whether FDA was taking those concerns into account so as not to worsen potential supply chain shortages that could affect patient access to devices, and whether it had the resources needed to handle the influx of applications.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nShuren said that FDA is still reviewing the comments but encouraged manufacturers to not wait for the PHE to be over to transition their products to regular marketing status. He said if device makers know they plan to make that transition they should come to FDA as soon as possible with their data and start the process.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n“Also remember the product is already on the market and we\\\u0027re going to focus on new product applications but we\\\u0027re not going to disenfranchise anyone who already has their product on the market,” he added.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nA major concern that Shuren and other FDA leadership have raised during the pandemic is they are worried that experienced staff are burning out from their pandemic workload and potentially leaving the agency. The director noted that work flexibility such as being allowed to work from home has helped the agency keep staff and they are seeing better recruitment than ever before. However, one thing he said that could be very helpful in recruiting more people is if Congress gave FDA direct hiring authority that isn’t tied to certain legislation such as the 21st Century Cures Act.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n\"If we find the right person, let\\\u0027s bring them in as quickly as possible,\" said Shuren.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nMaybe the most contentious issue between FDA and industry during the MDUFA V negotiations was the agency’s wish to create a total product lifecycle advisory program (TAP) that could incorporate external stakeholders such as physicians and insurance providers during the presubmission process. While industry pushed back on the issue stating it didn’t think there was a lot of interest from external stakeholders to participate in the program, FDA argued it could help manufacturers better understand what users and insurers want to see in a product to better inform its development. Ultimately, the two sides agreed to start off with a TAP pilot program to see if it is successful.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nRep. Brett Guthrie (R-KY) asked Shuren what the difference was between the TAP program and FDA’s presubmission program that allows product sponsors to discuss product development before submitting their device for agency review.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nShuren noted that while the presubmission program was immensely popular with sponsors, it’s narrowly structured to address individual questions in a back-and-forth process that can be relatively slow. The TAP program on the other hand according to the director address bigger marketing questions close to real-time.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nHe said it also addresses a major issue that the medtech industry has long complained about called the “valley of death,” which is the time between when a product gets FDA marketing authorization and when it starts getting reimbursed by insurers based on factors such as clinical meaningfulness.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n\"If we can solve the challenges before we get the submission, we\\\u0027re not talking about saving days, we\\\u0027re talking about saving months and years in getting to yes more efficiently,” said Shuren. “TAP can be a gamechanger, and this is what we learned from COVID that it really works, it\\\u0027s part of the secret sauce, that got those 2,200 devices out onto the market.\"\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nWhen asked about the fact MDUFA V potentially almost doubles its expected revenue compared to MDUFA IV, Shuren stated that the previous user fee deal was under-resourced, and the agency had no way to adjust it.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nBy contrast, he added the MDUFA V deal is designed to deal with resource gaps while also allowing the agency to improve its performance goals which includes the TAP pilot program, more funding for analyzing real-world evidence, adopting national and international consensus standards and driving international harmonization, which Shuren characterized as the “next frontier.”\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nOn a separate matter, Eshoo also noted that in June 2021, FDA published a draft guidance that attempts to clarify the different between servicing and remanufacturing. She asked whether the agency needs further clarification of the terms in statute which presumably could be added as an amendment when the reauthorization bill is passed. (RELATED: FDA explains when device \\\u0027servicing\\\u0027 becomes \\\u0027remanufacturing\\\u0027, Regulatory Focus 17 June 2021)\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nShuren said that FDA is still looking over the comments but \"there is value in providing greater clarity and maybe even doing so through statute.”\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n“When we saw reports come in with servicing [adverse events] most of those had to do with remanufacturing, so clarity about what constitutes and what doesn\\\u0027t constitute remanufacturing is important,” he added.\\r\\n\\xa0\\nHearing\\n\u0027},\n  {\u0027identifier\u0027: \u0027https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles\u0027,\n   \u0027title\u0027: \u0027fda approvals roundup: pluvicto, cabenuva, fintepla\u0027,\n   \u0027url\u0027: \u0027https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2022/3/fda-approvals-roundup-pluvicto-cabenuva-fintepla\u0027,\n   \u0027date\u0027: \u002730-03-2022\u0027,\n   \u0027keywords\u0027: \u0027approval\u0027,\n   \u0027content\u0027: \"\\n      A weekly update on new drug approvals and indications from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\\r\\n\\xa0\\nNew approval\\nPluvicto approved for metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer\\r\\nAdvanced Accelerator Applications’ Pluvicto (lutetium [Lu 177] vipivotide tetraxetan; injection) is approved as a radioligand therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in men who are positive for prostate-specific membrane antigen and have been treated with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor and taxane-based chemotherapy.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nLocametz (gallium Ga 68 gozetotide), a radioactive diagnostic agent, was concurrently approved for selecting patients for treating with Pluvicto.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nApproval of Pluvicto was based on findings from the multicenter, open label VISION trial in which patients from the indicated population were randomized 2:1 to receive Pluvicto plus best standard of care (BSoC; 551 patients) or BSoC alone (280 patients).

The allegation centers on content published on Facebook and YouTube.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nVaxine has raised AU$1 million through a crowdfunding campaign to push for approval of its recombinant protein COVID-19 vaccine candidate, Advax-CpG55.2, in its home market of Australia. TGA granted Vaxine provisional determination late last year, clearing it to apply for provisional registration in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nTGA issued Vaxine with an infringement notice because the company “did not adequately address a range of concerns with the social media advertisement” that the agency raised with the company’s director by phone and in writing.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nTGA said that, while factual information about clinical trials is published on Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry and related overseas registries, sponsors cannot advertise unapproved goods such as candidates undergoing clinical trials because they are yet to complete assessment by the agency.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n“Publicly available information about any clinical trial must be factual and balanced and must not promote the use or supply of the therapeutic goods that are the subject of the trial.

The other documents cover prohibited medical device manufacturing and compiling quality agreements. NMPA framed the documents as a way to strengthen the supervision of medical device production and ensure the safety and effectiveness of products sold in China.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nThe release of the documents comes one year after China’s State Council released details of a significant revision to the medical device regulatory framework. The revised framework clarified that medical device marketing authorization holders are responsible for the safety of and effectiveness of their products throughout the life cycle.\\r\\n\\xa0\\nNMPA Notice (Chinese)\\r\\n\\xa0\\nIndia approves Novavax’s COVID vaccine for use in adolescents\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nThe Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. Novavax said the DCGI decision is the first authorization of its protein-based vaccine in the adolescent population.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nWorking with the Serum Institute of India, Novavax secured EUA for its NVX-CoV2373 vaccine in India in adults late last year. The extension of the label to cover adolescents is underpinned by a phase 2/3 clinical trial that studied the vaccine in 460 Indian individuals aged 12 to 18 years. According to Novavax, the trial showed NVX-CoV2373 “was well-tolerated with a reassuring safety profile.”\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nThe EUA filing also referenced data from a US clinical trial that delivered topline data earlier this year. That study, which took place before the rapid rise of the Omicron variant, linked the vaccine to 82% clinical efficacy against the Delta variant.\\r\\n\\xa0\\nPress Release\\r\\n\\xa0\\nChina’s NMPA prepares for WHO assessment of vaccine regulatory capacity\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nChina’s NMPA has held a meeting in preparation for a national regulatory authority (NRA) assessment of vaccines by the World Health Organization (WHO). The assessment will cover China’s vaccine regulatory capacity and level.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nVaccine regulation has been a source of headaches for China in recent years, with scandals such as the discovery that Changsheng Biotechnology had fabricated production and inspection records rocking the country. Since then, Chinese authorities have sought to improve oversight, jailing some ex-regulatory officials and taking steps to enhance quality management and traceability.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nThe upcoming WHO assessment in June represents a test of China’s vaccine regulatory capacity and level. NMPA wants to ensure China passess the test and lays the groundwork for future enhancements to the system.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n“In terms of current problems and challenges, it is important to carefully analyze causes and accelerate rectification and improvement. Efforts should be made not only to pass the assessment, but also to lay a solid foundation for the modernization of China\u0027s vaccine regulatory system and capacity in the long run,” NMPA wrote.\\r\\n\\xa0\\nNMPA Notice\\r\\n\\xa0\\nOther news:\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nThe Philippine FDA has issued warnings against the purchase of a clutch of counterfeit products.
